# Privacy Policy for VoiceReminder

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

## Overview

VoiceReminder ("the App") is a voice-based reminder application that allows you to speak your reminders and receive audio notifications. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Voice Recordings
- **What we collect:** When you create a reminder, your voice is recorded temporarily.
- **How we use it:** Your voice recording is sent to our secure servers for processing (speech-to-text conversion and voice synthesis). 
- **Retention:** Voice recordings are processed in real-time and are not permanently stored on our servers. The generated reminder audio is stored locally on your device only.

### Reminder Data
- **Storage:** All reminder data (titles, times, schedules) is stored locally on your device.
- **No cloud sync:** We do not sync or backup your reminders to any cloud service.

### Permissions

The App requires the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Microphone** | To record your voice when creating reminders |
| **Notifications** | To alert you when reminders are due |

## Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Sell your personal data
- Share your data with third parties for advertising
- Track your location
- Collect analytics about your usage

## Third-Party Services

The App uses:
- **OpenAI Whisper** - For speech-to-text conversion
- **ElevenLabs** - For text-to-speech audio generation

These services process your voice data solely to provide the reminder functionality. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.

## Data Security

- All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS
- Voice recordings are processed in memory and not persisted
- Local data is stored using your device's secure storage mechanisms

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Your Rights

You can:
- Delete any reminder at any time (this removes all associated data from your device)
